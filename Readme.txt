The repository consists of two python jupyter notebooks and an excel file. The excel file details the experiments conducted on residual networks. The code for the Resnet18 network (the one with the highest
accuracy) is given in the Tester.ipynb file while the preactivated Resnet101 trained for 200 epochs is in the Resnet101_Preactivation.ipynb file. 
The link for pre-activated residual networks is - https://towardsdatascience.com/resnet-with-identity-mapping-over-1000-layers-reached-image-classification-bb50a42af03e (they're merely residual networks with identity mapping and
are used to tackle the degradation problem)
